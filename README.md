#### Summary:
  When reviewing the visuals regarding the number of users by gender, you can see that there is statistical significance of male users compaired to female users. Male users are more likely to use the bike-share program and be a subscriber as well. Also the starting locations of high tourist areas shows customers are more likely to use the bike-sharing program. These are two key points that need to be reviewed when reviewing the business model in Des Moines. There needs to be high tourist areas and a large male population to increase profitiablity. 
   More data is always better and seeing the comaprision to the number of bikes Citibike owns compared to its overall profits would help scale the Des Moines business appropriately. Also understanding the relationship of NYC population to the number of bike-sharing users would also get a better idea of scale the Des Moines business should start with.
